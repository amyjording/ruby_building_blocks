stock1.rb is not properly working version of a solution, but is what I came up
with on my own without looking for direct answer help.  I thought of solutions
and looked up help on the principles of my ideas and then took it as far as I could.

Finally after so much struggle while hitting some dead ends, it was time to get
some help and I found it.

stock2.rb represents my solution with example based help.

I learned that I was onto the right idea but trying to hard to force things to
process in a harder way than they needed to.

For example, I was trying to pinpoint index numbers and drop them into either another
array or a hash to try to run comparisons, only to find that comparisons of index
numbers aren't really what they are for.

Finally I learned that a simple (-2) on the array index location (something I was
vaguely aware of but unable to connect this with my solution approach) was enough
to ensure that the stock 'buy' was never in a positon that wouldn't allow for a sell.
